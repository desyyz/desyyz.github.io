      I am currently studying IT Application Development and have a strong

      modern interfaces and working with real-world tools such as WordPress
      and hosting platforms.

        <h3>Soul Linen – WordPress Website</h3>

        <p>
          Soul Linen is a modern WordPress website designed with a clean and
          calming aesthetic. The project focused on layout, responsiveness,
          and user experience while maintaining a professional look.
        </p>

        <p>
          I customized themes, structured content, and styled the site to
          achieve a modern design. The website was deployed and managed using
          Pantheon, giving me experience with real-world hosting environments.
